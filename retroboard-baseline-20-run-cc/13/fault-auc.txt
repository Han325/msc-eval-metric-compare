--- STARTING DIAGNOSTIC RUN ---
### STEP 1: Reading CSV file from: /home/vagrant-code-coverage/Desktop/fault_discovery_rate.csv

### STEP 2: RAW DATA FROM CSV ###
This is the ENTIRE content of the CSV file:
   test_case_number  cumulative_unique_faults
0                 1                         1
1                 2                         1
2                 3                         1
3                 4                         1
4                 5                         1
---------------------------------

### STEP 3: KEY VARIABLES ###
Max faults found (max_faults): 1
Total number of tests (max_tests): 5
-----------------------------

### STEP 4: AREA CALCULATION LOOP ###
Calculating the area under the curve piece by piece...
  - Interval 1 (between test 1 and 2):
    - Faults at end of previous test: 1
    - Faults at end of current test:  1
    - Area of this piece: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.0
    - Running total for actual_area: 1.0
  - Interval 2 (between test 2 and 3):
    - Faults at end of previous test: 1
    - Faults at end of current test:  1
    - Area of this piece: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.0
    - Running total for actual_area: 2.0
  - Interval 3 (between test 3 and 4):
    - Faults at end of previous test: 1
    - Faults at end of current test:  1
    - Area of this piece: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.0
    - Running total for actual_area: 3.0
  - Interval 4 (between test 4 and 5):
    - Faults at end of previous test: 1
    - Faults at end of current test:  1
    - Area of this piece: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.0
    - Running total for actual_area: 4.0

  >>> FINAL Calculated Area (actual_area): 4.0
-----------------------------------

### STEP 5: 'PERFECT' SCENARIO CALCULATION ###
Max faults (1) * (Number of tests (5) - 1) = 4
  >>> 'Perfect' Area (perfect_area): 4
------------------------------------------

### STEP 6: FINAL SCORE CALCULATION ###
  >>> Final Score = actual_area (4.0) / perfect_area (4) = 1.0
-------------------------------------


--- Fault Discovery Analysis ---
Analysis complete. Plot saved to '/home/vagrant-code-coverage/Desktop/discovery_curve.png'
A score of 1.0 represents a perfect test suite (all faults found on the first test).
Your Test Suite's Discovery Score: 1.0000
